"Balanced Neural Networks under Fading Memory"
This Thesis is not yet finished.
Currently editing my Bachelor Thesis and writing down the results.
A first version will be uploaded shortly.

I am writing about Balanced Network in the field of Neuroscience.
I started creating a numeric implementation of the balanced network
described by Vreeswijk and Somponlinsky in their 1998 paper.  
Then, I looked at if and how external input can be deduced 
from later activation levels and under which cases the chaotic 
regime dominates.
Furthermore, I added a visual interface for others to play with the network aswell.

Advisor on my Bachelor Thesis is Prof. Triesch at 
Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies (FIAS).
